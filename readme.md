## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

- From this project i learnt about how hard to get a component if the component doesnt have an ID, so i have to be thorough to get the element
- There's some case while in the middle of automation, the website showed some ad pop up and i cant skip the ad. The ad make the automation error, i found some trick to just refresh the page and automate from the beginning.
